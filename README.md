### Decentralized Renewable-Powered P2P LLM Network Specification

---

#### **1. Overview**

A globally distributed, peer-to-peer (P2P) network for large language models (LLMs) that ensures:

* Privacy: All queries remain on local nodes unless federated updates are performed.
* Censorship resistance: No central authority controls outputs.
* Renewable energy utilization: Inferers only operate when powered by solar, wind, or other green energy sources.
* Continuous operation: Geographic distribution ensures night/day operation.
* Community-driven model selection: Nodes vote on the model to use, ensuring it fits inferer constraints.

---

#### **2. Node Roles**

1. **Inferers**

   * Machines with sufficient VRAM to run full LLMs (e.g., Gemma 27B Q4 requires \~24 GB).
   * Responsibilities:

     * Run local inference for themselves and optionally for light users.
     * Report renewable energy headroom to referee nodes.
     * Participate in federated updates when surplus renewable energy is available.
     * Participate in model voting and selection.
   * Energy management:

     * Integrate renewable adapters to report real-time energy availability.
     * Compute rolling averages (30–60 sec) and apply hysteresis thresholds.
     * Idle GPU and unload model if energy headroom drops below thresholds.

2. **Light Users**

   * Machines without sufficient VRAM to run the full model.
   * Responsibilities:

     * Submit inference queries to available inferers.
     * Participate in federated updates (lightweight gradient contributions).
   * No heavy GPU usage; minimal energy footprint.

3. **Referee Nodes**

   * Coordinate query routing and load balancing.
   * Monitor global inferer energy availability.
   * Assign queries to inferers with sufficient renewable headroom and capacity.
   * Enforce inferer-to-user ratio to prevent overload.

---

#### **3. Renewable Energy Integration**

* Each inferer must run on renewable energy (solar/wind/battery).

* Power reporting:

  * Use adapters to normalize different inverter APIs into a standard format.
  * Report: available power, battery state, renewable headroom, timestamp.

* Thresholds and hysteresis:

  * GPU activates if renewable headroom > upper threshold.
  * GPU idles/unloads if headroom < lower threshold.
  * Rolling average smoothing prevents load/unload chatter.

* Optional battery integration:

  * Inferers may continue running at reduced capacity if stored renewable energy allows.

---

#### **4. Inference Workflow**

1. Light user submits query.
2. Referee selects inferer with sufficient renewable headroom and available compute.
3. Inferer processes query locally.
4. Output returned to user.
5. Federated updates (optional):

   * Performed only when inferers have surplus renewable energy.
   * Only weight updates/gradients are shared, never raw queries.

---

#### **5. Model Selection & Voting**

* **Voting principles:**

  * Only inferers participate in votes.
  * Models must meet VRAM, energy, and latency constraints.
* **Voting workflow:**

  1. Proposal stage: Community submits candidate models with metrics and licensing.
  2. Evaluation stage: Nodes test benchmarks (inference speed, throughput, energy usage, accuracy).
  3. Voting stage: Nodes cast votes; weighted voting optionally considers node capacity.
  4. Selection stage: Model with majority or supermajority is adopted.
* **Model updates:**

  * Voting can be repeated for upgrades or model changes.
  * Federated updates evolve the model without central authority interference.

---

#### **6. Global Distribution**

* Geographic diversity ensures at least some inferers have sufficient renewable power at all times.
* Referee dynamically routes queries based on:

  * Location and time zone
  * Renewable headroom
  * Current load
* Network achieves near 24/7 operation without fossil-fuel energy.

---

#### **7. Network Management**

* **Inferer-to-user ratio** enforced (e.g., 1 inferer per 5–10 light users).
* Load balancing prevents inferers from being overwhelmed.
* Optional caching reduces repeated queries to distant inferers.
* Security:

  * Energy reporting and task assignment must be tamper-resistant.
  * Federated updates should use cryptographic verification to prevent malicious contributions.

---

#### **8. Software Components**

1. **Renewable Adapter Layer**

   * Abstracts inverter APIs to a standard reporting interface.
2. **Local Inference Engine**

   * Runs LLM on GPU (or CPU if feasible).
3. **Federated Update Engine**

   * Handles secure weight/gradient sharing between nodes.
4. **Referee Scheduler**

   * Assigns queries based on energy availability, load, and inferer-to-user ratio.
5. **Voting Module**

   * Manages model proposals, evaluation, voting, and adoption.
6. **Monitoring & Logging**

   * Tracks node status, energy headroom, query throughput, model votes, and updates.

#### **9. Implementation Roadmap**

1. **Phase 1 (Today)**

   * Small-scale hobbyist network (2–3 nodes).
   * Full local inference + periodic federated updates.
   * Manual renewable adapters.
   * Initial model voting among participating inferers.

2. **Phase 2 (1–3 years)**

   * Semi-automated P2P updates.
   * Community-maintained adapters for common inverters.
   * Cryptographic verification of updates.
   * Small-to-medium sized networks.
   * Formalized voting process for model selection.

3. **Phase 3 (5+ years)**

   * Plug-and-play P2P AI networks.
   * Lightweight models for broader adoption.
   * Global geographic distribution.
   * Optional collaborative sharding for high-bandwidth nodes.
   * Continuous model voting for upgrades and evolution.

#### **10. Summary**

This specification outlines a **privacy-focused, renewable-powered, globally distributed P2P LLM network** with:

* Full local inference on inferers.
* Light user support.
* Federated model updates.
* Energy-aware scheduling with rolling averaging and hysteresis.
* Global distribution for continuous operation.
* Community-driven model selection via inferer voting.

The design emphasizes **sustainability, privacy, accessibility, and democratic governance**, while remaining feasible for hobbyist and professional implementation.
